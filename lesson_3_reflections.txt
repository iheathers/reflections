Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That's my choice to either pull the change and stay on my own track of business.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking allows to clone within github
clone allows to clone within local as well as from remote to local
Branching is just going two or different ways instead of linear path change 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can diverge out from your updated branch to continue with the latest synced state, view changes and merge finally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Ans:
Since i dont know any other version control system i would probably use gmail. I would have to comment on each change or i would comment the change in the code itself; what it was before and what it ought to be.
