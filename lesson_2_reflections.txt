What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
@
when i initialize a repository, i can keep track of its metadata if i want (maybe). A .git file is added to that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

@It is intermediate state. It allows you to think over before you make any changes to repository. It allows you to allocate file(s) that you want to commit.
