What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
@
when i initialize a repository, i can keep track of its metadata if i want (maybe). A .git file is added to that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

@It is intermediate state. It allows you to think over before you make any changes to repository. It allows you to allocate file(s) that you want to commit.





How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Though i have changed two or more files, i can add one (more) that has single logical change to staging area and add commit to it.
That way the work is done.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
@ When i want to divert the project from main objective or into other language before trying out other feature, branches can help me a lot.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
@ns:
diagrams shows relations between parent and child commits(or you can say so), it can show reachability of any particular commit from another. It helps to keep track of where you are actually in the branch.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
@ns:
i can get updated file with both the feature that i merged. We represent it in the diagram as we usually do because it makes easy  for us to visualize the concept.
